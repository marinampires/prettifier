Task


Write tested code (any language) that accepts a numeric type and returns a truncated, "prettified" string version. 
The prettified version should include one number after the decimal when the truncated number is not an integer. It should prettify numbers greater than 6 digits and support millions, billions and trillions. You should use short scale numbers to output the prettified number.

Examples:

input: 1000000 output: 1M

input: 2500000.34 output: 2.5M

input: 532 output: 532

input: 1123456789 output: 1.1B

Please provide with your code any supporting information once you are done. Include a brief overview describing your approach, assumptions, design decisions, requirements questions, or anything you think needs clarification. Be prepared to discuss in more detail and iterate on the problem.
